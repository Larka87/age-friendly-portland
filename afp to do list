Age Friendly Portland To Do List:

-Articles using advance custom fields (I am trying to tackle this today)

-Contact Page 
Content is in. Needs Style and the contact form. I looked at using Contact form 7, but it's up to whoever is doing it.)  

-Text size buttons implementation and styles.

-Events Page 
Who ever works on this don’t worry that they haven’t given us any events. Just create some fake test events so we can get the styles down and show them how it will work.

-Tools page

-Input Advisory Committee
I believe this will be going under Partner Information. I emailed her to confirm though. Contact Chris before working on this.

- Footer’s Article and Events

-Fine tune styles

-Test in IE8+

Age Friendly Portland To Do List:

-Articles using advance custom fields (I am trying to tackle this today 8/11/2013)

-Contact Page 
Content is in. Needs Style and the contact form. I looked at using Contact form 7, but it's up to whoever is doing it.)  
:: edit ::
The ACF now has a Content Form 7 addon that works with the plugin, the issue we are facing is that the pathing within the function.php file doesn't want to direct the file to the correct place.

-Text size buttons implementation and styles.
:: edit :: 
Have the text resizer entered and is working however the surrounding bar needs to be adjusted to react to font resizing, we should also consider implimenting a max & min size.


-Events Page 
Who ever works on this don’t worry that they haven’t given us any events. Just create some fake test events so we can get the styles down and show them how it will work.
:: edit ::
Added an easy to update events page, just have to make the plugin work correctly within the footer.


-Tools page

-Input Advisory Committee
I believe this will be going under Partner Information. I emailed her to confirm though. Contact Chris before working on this.
